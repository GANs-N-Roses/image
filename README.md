This repository comprises the image sentiment analysis model training for the GANs & Roses project. It includes some utils, including bulk downloading the paintings in [The Wikiart Emotions Dataset](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/wikiartemotions.html) and some pre-processing to get the annotations fit our needs.

For the end-to-end, ready for deployment art to music pipeline, check out our [deploy repository](https://github.com/GANs-N-Roses/deploy). If you are interested in geting to know more about the GANs & Roses project, you might enjoy reading our [Medium article](https://medium.com/@atmguille/d1a7cfe8d59a).
